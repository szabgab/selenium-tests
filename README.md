## TODO

* Add flags to be able to run headless (but that should be a flag)
* Be able to run the script on Travis-CI.

* Check the main pages of

```
https://code-maven.com/
https://perlmaven.com/
https://pydigger.com/
https://szabgab.com/
```

for now checking the title would be enough.

* Check https://code-maven.com/slides/
* Check clicking on ? on the slides - is there a pop-up
* Check the various keyboard shortcuts (they use JavaScript). Check the 'a' key and how the admin web page works.


* Can we check the visibility of objects as we resize the browser?
